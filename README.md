## overview 
This is a 2d Top-Down game made using Python & Pygames, it is quite simple and features animations, states, enemy AI, attacks, sound effects and more.  This game has 3 levels with bosses at the end of each level, the bosses are linear and supposed to get harder as the user advances. The levels are written in plain text, each number in the map file represents a certain type of tile so its very important to have them. It is currently in beta mode, it will be further developed according to the roadmap.



## Future Plans/Roadmap 
- Add more levels and make it more open world style 
- Fix some bugs 
- Inventory system with more weapons
- Interactive houses/huts with NPCs 
- upgrade system 
### Long term plans
- Make a 3d continuation game using unreal engine 5
- P2E concept for Dungeon slayer ( where people can play the game on a certain blockchain and earn tokens in return )
